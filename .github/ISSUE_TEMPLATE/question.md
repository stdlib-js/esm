GitHub issues are intended for reporting bugs, so we recommend not using this medium for asking general (non-bug related) questions. 😁

If you have a support request or a general question, please ask on other available channels:

-   [Gitter][stdlib-gitter]
-   [Twitter][stdlib-twitter]

Also be sure to consult the [FAQ][faq] in case we have already answered your question there.

Thank you for your interest in the project!
